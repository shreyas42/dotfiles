So here's the difference between .profile, .bash_profile and .bashrc
When we first boot up our computer (in the absence of a window/desktop manager),
the OS launches the program gettty(), which as the name suggests opens an interactive tty session and starts
bash(in our case) as a login shell. Login shells are a little different from regular interactive bash shells

When starting a login shell from tty - it reads .bash_profile
An alternative to .bash_profile is .profile, some login shells read this

.xinitrc is used by startx. Any commands present in this file will be executed by startx.
Keep in mind that any command after 'exec i3' (or the window manager of your choice)
will not run, so make sure you launch background processes before that.
I keep some commands that I want run in the .xprofile and source .xprofile from .xinitrc

Individual configuration files for each installed program (i3, ranger, polybar, etc) can be
found inside the .config/ folder in the $HOME.
